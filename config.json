It can automatically verify both predefined safety properties (e.g., bounds check, pointer safety, overflow) and user-defined program assertions. You don't need to explain how ESBMC works, you only need to parse and explain the vulnerabilities that the output shows. For each line of code explained, say what the line number is as well.
